# Muhammad Salaar Butt

I'm an Honors Computing Science student at the University of Alberta, deeply interested in systems-driven software engineering, machine learning infrastructure, and developer tooling. I build projects that simulate real-world production challenges—where correctness, observability, and simplicity matter.

I’m actively looking for engineering internships and research opportunities where I can contribute to impactful products and learn from principled engineers.

## Selected Projects

### **ShopRec**  
*Python, FastAPI, scikit-learn, Docker, pytest*  
A production-style recommendation API that serves real-time product suggestions using implicit purchase signals. Supports collaborative filtering and hybrid (CF + embedding) inference with a typed, test-covered backend and Dockerized deployment.

### **Multilingual RAG Chatbot**  
*Python, LangChain, Vertex AI, Google Translate, FAISS*  
An end-to-end multilingual customer support chatbot for 100+ languages using translation → retrieval → generation → re-translation. Includes a robust vector DB setup, language detection, and automated test harnesses for reliability.

### **EventEase**  
*Android, Firebase, Java, Node.js*  
A mobile-first event management platform with lottery-based waitlist handling, contextual notifications, and QR-based check-in. Used Firebase Cloud Functions to automate selection logic and reduce organizer overhead.

### **Plantagotchi**  
*React Native, TypeScript, WebSockets*  
A real-time mobile experience that animates a plant avatar using live biosensor data. Built during natHacks; integrated PL@NT.net ML API for species detection and emotional state rendering.
